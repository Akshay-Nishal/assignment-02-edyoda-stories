                        <p class="discription">If you learn cloud computing then you can make things much easier for your projects. You do not have to rely on multiple hard drives or data storage devices for with cloud computing you can store all your important data on a remote database. To put it simply cloud computing offers the delivery of different services through the internet. These services include tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. For a more efficient and smooth workflow, cloud computing surely seems to be taking over, and more and more people are moving to use it to the best of its services. Here’s all you need to know about it.</p>

                        <p class="discription">The process used by companies to convert raw data into useful information is called Data Mining. It is a process of searching, collecting, filtering and analyzing the data. A large amount of data can be retrieved from various websites and databases. It can be retrieved in the form of data relationships, correlations, and patterns. With the advent of computers, the internet, and large databases it is possible to collect large amounts of data. The data collected may be analyzed steadily and help identify relationships and find solutions to existing problems. Governments, private companies, large organizations, and all businesses are after a large volume of data collection for the purposes of business and research development. The data collected can be stored for future use.</p>

                        <p class="discription">Software is all around us and it shapes the world differently. It shapes how the objects are designed, what information we receive, how and where we work, who we meet and communicate. Each generation of computing technology brings new ways of creative tools, new forms of data and new ways to interact themselves. From the time we send messages through pager in hand to the time our voice command does everything for us, the software has a great role to play in. With the rise of the development of software, the need for software testing also rose. Software testing or Automation Testing plays a great role when the software is in the development phase. It aims to make the software perfect through various levels of testing for the convenience of humans.</p>
